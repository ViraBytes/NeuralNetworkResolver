# Neural Network Resolver for CS:GO HvH  
**Project Status:** ~~Active~~ **Discontinued**  

---

## 🚨 Project Discontinuation Notice  

With the end of **CS:GO** as we knew it and the transition to **Counter-Strike 2 (CS2)**, this project has been officially discontinued. The changes in the game’s architecture, anti-cheat mechanisms, and overall ecosystem made it impossible to continue development in a meaningful way.  

While this marks the end of an era, I want to take a moment to reflect on the journey and express my heartfelt gratitude to everyone who supported this project.

## 🙏 A Thank You to the Community  

To all the loyal users who believed in this project and supported it by purchasing monthly subscriptions for the LUA script: **thank you**. Your trust, feedback, and enthusiasm were the driving forces behind this project. It was an incredible experience to see how the community embraced the AI-powered resolver and used it to push the boundaries of what was possible in CS:GO HvH.  

Your support not only kept the project alive but also inspired me to continuously improve and innovate. For that, I am deeply grateful.

## 🧠 What Was This Project About?  

This project aimed to revolutionize CS:GO HvH (Hacker vs. Hacker) by leveraging **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to create a neural network-based resolver. The resolver was designed to analyze and predict the opponent’s AntiAim behavior in real time, ensuring accurate headshots even in the most challenging scenarios.  

### Key Features:  
- **🤖 AI-Powered AntiAim Detection**: A neural network was trained to recognize and predict the opponent’s AntiAim patterns.  
- **⚡ Real-Time Performance**: The system operated seamlessly during gameplay, providing real-time analysis and adjustments.  
- **🔧 Customizable Framework**: Built on a robust LUA scripting system, the project allowed users to modify and extend its functionality.

## ❓ Why Was It Discontinued?  

With the release of **Counter-Strike 2 (CS2)**, the technical foundation of CS:GO was completely overhauled. The changes in the game’s engine, anti-cheat systems, and overall architecture made it impossible to adapt the project to the new environment. Additionally, the shift in the gaming community’s focus from CS:GO to CS2 rendered the project obsolete.

## 🎉 Final Words  

Thank you once again to everyone who was part of this journey. It’s bittersweet to say goodbye, but I’m proud of what we accomplished together. Farewell, and may your future gaming adventures be just as thrilling!
